# Research Experience & Publications

## Current Research
### Supporting Children to Develop AI Literacy through Experiential Learning
*Research Assistant at Tangible Embodied Child-Computer Interaction (TECI) Lab, Simon Fraser University*  
Sep 2024 - Present

My current research focuses on developing approaches to help children build AI literacy through hands-on, experiential learning activities. This work is being conducted at the TECI Lab under the supervision of faculty at Simon Fraser University's School of Interactive Arts and Technology.

## Past Research
### Online Exam Proctoring In Resource-Constrained Settings
*Undergraduate Researcher, UCSC Spatial Experience And Human-Computer Interaction Lab*  
May 2021 - May 2022

This research focused on understanding and addressing the challenges of conducting online exams in resource-constrained environments, with particular emphasis on Sri Lanka. The project included:

- Mixed-methods study to identify challenges in scaling online exams
- Design and implementation of a deep learning-based video action recognition system
- Development of a framework for online exam proctoring in resource-constrained settings
